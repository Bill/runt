Send suggestions, questions, threats, etc. for this list to Matt[mailto:matt@digitalclash.com]

=== To Do

* Complete general refactoring/renaming so that unit tests are readable by humans

* RAA deployment

* GEM deployment

* Better RDoc's which include usage examples, particularly for TE's

* More tutorials, particularly for Schedule API

* Make Schedule a Module instead of a class

* Address performance issues due to implementation (in particular, PDate#<=>)

* Properly implement/test Range functionality in DateRange

* Use RDoc properly so Runt website and README don't cause DRY violations
