= Runt - Ruby Temporal Expressions -- To Do List

Send suggestions, questions, threats, etc. for this list to Matt[mailto:matt@digitalclash.com]

=== To Do

* Better RDoc's which include usage examples

* More tutorials

* Address performance issues due to implementation (in particular, TimePoint#<=>)

* Test whether performance improves after declaring block params prior to invocation

* Properly implement/test Range functionality in DateRange

* Make Schedule a Module instead of a class

* Use RDoc properly so Runt website and README don't cause DRY violations

* Figure out why stupid IE downloads the runt-0.0.x.zip file using some f*'d up file name

* The rest of this TODO list...
