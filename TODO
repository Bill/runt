=== To Do

* Schedule tutorial

* Make Schedule a Module instead of a class

* Better RDoc's which include usage examples

* Properly implement/test Range functionality in DateRange

* Address performance issues due to implementation (in particular, PDate#<=>)

* Use RDoc properly so Runt website and README don't cause DRY violations
